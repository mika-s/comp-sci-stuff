# Data types and structures

## Data types

A data type is a classification identifying one of various types of data,
such as real, integer or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type;
the operations that can be done on values that type; the meaning of the data; and the
way values of that type can be stored.

### Classes of data types

* Machine data types: bit, byte, word
* Boolean data types: true and false
* Numeric data types: integer, floating point, fixed point, bignum or arbitrary precision
* Composite data types: array, record/tuple/struct, union, tagged union, set, object
* Enumerated type: Type consisting of a set of named values. The enumerator names are usually
  identifiers that behave as constants.
* String and text types: character, string
* Pointers and references:
* Abstract data types: queue, set, stack, tree, graph, hash, smart pointer


## Data structures

### Various data structures

* Linked list: a linked list is a data structure consisting of groups of nodes which together
represent a sequence. Each node is composed of data and a reference to the next node in the
sequence. A single linked list only has a reference to the next node; a doubly linked list has
reference to both the next and the previous node.
* Stack: a stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. A stack has two principal operations:
push and pop. Push adds an element to the stack, while pop removes an element from the stack. The
last element to be pushed will be removed.
* Queue: a queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. When a new element is added,
the first element will be removed.
* Tree: a tree is a data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure. It contains a
root and one or more subtrees.
* Hash table:
* Heap:
